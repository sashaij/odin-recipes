    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pancakes are a weekend tradition in my household. Typically we make classic buttermilk, but lately, we can’t get enough of these ultra-hearty oatmeal pancakes. They’re sweetened with banana, kissed with cinnamon, and also happen to be gluten-free.</p>
    <p>Did I mention they’re also easy to make? The batter comes together in minutes in a blender or food processor, and you might have all the ingredients you need in your kitchen right now. In fact, these pancakes are so quick, simple, and wholesome, they could easily become part of your weekday morning routine, too. Here’s how to make them.</p>
