    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancakes are a weekend tradition in my household. Typically we make classic buttermilk, but lately, we can’t get enough of these ultra-hearty oatmeal pancakes. They’re sweetened with banana, kissed with cinnamon, and also happen to be gluten-free.</p>
    <p>Did I mention they’re also easy to make? The batter comes together in minutes in a blender or food processor, and you might have all the ingredients you need in your kitchen right now. In fact, these pancakes are so quick, simple, and wholesome, they could easily become part of your weekday morning routine, too. Here’s how to make them.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, divided</li>
        <li>2 very ripe large bananas</li>
        <li>1 cup milk, regular or non-dairy</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons unsalted butter or vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li><em>For topping</em>: maple syrup, chopped pecans, sliced banana, or fresh berries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grind the oats into flour. </strong>Place 1 cup of the old-fashioned rolled oats in a blender or food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process or blend until well-ground and flour-like, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the bananas and purée. </strong>Break 2 large bananas in half and add to ground oats. Process until mostly smooth, 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend in the remaining ingredients. </strong>Add the remaining 1/2 cup oats, 1 cup milk, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Blend until just combined, 15 to 30 seconds. If desired, transfer batter to a bowl or liquid measuring cup to make it easier to portion and fry.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest while the pan heats. </strong>Let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the first side. </strong>Add 1 teaspoon of the unsalted butter or vegetable oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Drop the batter into the pan in 1/4-cup portions, cooking 3 at a time. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, the edges begin to look dry, and the bottoms are golden-brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip and finish cooking. </strong>Flip the pancakes and cook until the second side is golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a warm oven or plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the remaining batter and serve. </strong>Repeat cooking the remaining batter, wiping out the skillet between batches as needed and adding 1 teaspoon butter or oil between each batch. Serve with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
