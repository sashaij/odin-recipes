    <h1>Oatmeal-Almond Protein Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="images/blender-pancakes-recipe-1.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Depending on the type of protein powder you pick, you might need to reduce the amount of liquid in this protein pancake recipe. Whey-protein pancakes need less liquid than those made with soy, hemp or pea protein. Serve with yogurt and a DIY fruit sauce (warmed frozen berries with a pinch of sugar).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unflavored protein powder</li>
        <li>½ cup almond meal</li>
        <li>½ cup oat flour (see Tip)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1. </strong><br>Combine protein powder, almond meal, oat flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a blender; pulse until fully mixed. Add eggs, buttermilk (reduce to 1/2 cup if using whey protein), oil and vanilla; pulse, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed, until combined. Let stand for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2. </strong><br>Coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3. </strong><br>Make about 3 pancakes at a time, using 1/4 cup batter per pancake; reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the edges are dry, 1 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 1 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining batter, using more cooking spray and reducing the heat as needed. Serve warm.</li>
